<p>Grilled cheese is <strong>a classic American sandwich that is usually prepared with one or more cheese varieties that are placed between two slices of bread.</strong> 
The slices are buttered from the outside, and the sandwich is then shortly heated, typically in a pan or on a griddle, until the bread is golden and the cheese melts.</p>
<h2>Ingredients (1 servings)</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
<li>2 slices white bread</li>    
<li>Â½ cup shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>    
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. 
Place bread slices in the skillet on top of the melted butter.</li>
<li>Spread about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese on one slice of bread; 
place the other slice of bread, butter-side up, on top of the cheese. 
Spread about 2 tablespoons of cheese on top of the sandwich.</li>
<li>Melt remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter in the skillet next to the sandwich. 
Flip the sandwich onto the melted butter so that the cheese-side is facing down. 
Spread remaining cheese on top of the sandwich. 
Cook sandwich until cheese on the bottom is crispy and caramelized, 3 to 4 minutes. 
Flip sandwich and cook until cheese is crispy and caramelized on the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
