<p>A <strong>cordon bleu</strong> or <em>schnitzel cordon bleu</em> is <strong>a dish of meat wrapped around cheese (or with cheese filling), then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried.</strong> 
Veal cordon bleu is made of veal pounded thin and wrapped around a slice of ham and a slice of cheese, breaded, and then pan fried or baked.
<strong>For this recipe we will be using chicken instead.</strong></p>
<h2>Ingredients (1 Servings)</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
<li>1 slices Swiss cheese</li>
<li>1 slices Beef ham</li>
<li>½ tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
<li>⅙ teaspoon paprika</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>⅙ teaspoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
<li>½ teaspoon cornstarch</li>
<li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon heavy whipping cream</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pound chicken breasts if they are too thick. 
Place a cheese and ham slice on each breast within 1/2 inch of the edges. 
Fold the edges of the chicken over the filling, and secure with toothpicks. 
Mix the flour and paprika in a small bowl, and coat the chicken pieces.</li>
<li>Heat the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook the chicken until browned on all sides. 
Add the bouillon. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear.</li>
<li>Remove the toothpicks, and transfer the breasts to a warm platter. 
Blend the cornstarch with the cream in a small bowl, and whisk slowly into the skillet. 
Cook, stirring until thickened, and pour over the chicken. Serve warm.</li>
